# Genomic Read Mapping Algorithms
Implementation of two combinatorial pattern matching algorithms to map randomly generated reads to a randomly generated reference genome. One is the Burrows-Wheeler Transform, and the other utilizes suffix arrays. Algorithms are based from an online textbook ( https://www.bioinformaticsalgorithms.org/ ). 
Mixed code styling was for personal learning purposes. Wanted practice with primitive array structures as well as play with newer standards.
